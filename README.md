# border-box.css

## How to use

**NPM**

```sh
npm i --save border-box.css
```

**Yarn**

```sh
yarn add border-box.css
```

Then, in your root application file: 

```import 'border-box.css'```

You will need to use a bundler like `webpack` that can process css files!

## What does it do?

* Apply `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements on a page. 
This makes development more consistent across all browsers.

## Really? You made an npm module just for this?

Yes, because I wanted to. NPM is filled with tiny modules. I created this so that 
I wouldn't forget to write this boilerplate in my projects. 

## Is this satire on the state of NPM?

Maybe. But it's also a module that does one thing really well!
