npm i --save border-box.css
```

**Yarn**

```sh
yarn add border-box.css

## What does it do?

* Apply `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements on a page. This makes development more consistent across all browsers.

## Really? You made an npm module just for this?

Yes, because I wanted to. NPM is filled with tiny modules. 

## Is this satire on the state of NPM?

Maybe. But it's also a module!
